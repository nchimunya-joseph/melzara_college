## Announcements
RRR Week Announcements

* Final exam logistics are posted at .
    * If you need an alternate time, remote exam, or accommodations (e.g. DSP), please request and fill out the logistics form.
    * We will try and make a more detailed post about scope once the exam is finalized later this week. We’ll only be lightly testing content that was covered after the strike started.
* For 1 extra credit point on the final, fill out the course evaluations, and submit proof to Google forms. Evaluations we will be sent weekly.
* Instructor office hours this week: Monday through Thursday, 9-5:30pm CAT, Friday, 9-13pm, online.
* We’ll work out a solution to the missing weeks of discussion attendance after the final exam is over, so please hold any questions about discussion attendance until then.

Course Reading Material

`Hennessy, J. L., and D. A. Patterson. Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach, 3rd ed.
San Mateo, CA: Morgan Kaufman, 2002. ISBN: 1558605967.`

- This is the main textbook used in this course. We also give the equivalent readings for the 2nd
edition of this book to allow you to use a secondhand copy. In previous years, some students
found that the lecture notes were sufficient to learn the material and that the textbook was
unnecessary, but we nevertheless recommend the book as a good reference guide.
* To review the basic material, you may also want to refer:

`Patterson, D. A., and J. L. Hennessy. Computer Organization and Design: The
Hardware/Software Interface, 3rd ed. San Mateo, CA: Morgan Kaufman, 2004. ISBN:
1558606041.`

- Supplemental readings from selected papers may also be assigned throughout the semester.
- There may be a nominal photocopying charge, always payable to MIT, for the supplemental
reading materials
