# Prerequisites
    - Mathematics for Computer Science
    - Principles of Discrete Applied Mathematics

# Course Description

This course emphasizes computability and computational complexity theory. Topics include regular and context-free languages, decidable and undecidable problems, reducibility, recursive function theory, time and space measures on computation, completeness, hierarchy theorems, inherently complex problems, oracles, probabilistic computation, and interactive proof systems.

# Course Outline
- Automata and Language Theory (2 weeks)
    - Finite automata, regular expressions, push-down automata, context-free grammars, pumping lemmas.
- Computability Theory (3 weeks)
    - Turing machines, the Church-Turing thesis, decidability, the halting problem, reducibility, the recursion theorem.
- Complexity Theory (7 weeks)
    - Time and space measures of complexity, complexity classes P, NP, L, NL, PSPACE, BPP and IP, complete problems, the P versus NP conjecture, quantifiers and games, hierarchy theorems, provably hard problems, relativized computation and oracles, probabilistic computation, interactive proof systems.

# Textbook

- `Sipser, Michael. Introduction to the Theory of Computation. 3rd ed. Cengage Learning, 2012. ISBN: 9781133187790.`

- You may use the second edition, but it is missing some additional practice problems. Errata for 2nd edition of textbook.

- We will cover Chapters `1, 2 (except 2.4), 3, 4, 5, 6.1, 7, 8, 9.1, 9.2, 10.2` (except the part on Primality), and `10.4` through Theorem `10.33`.

# Recitations

Recitations are primarily for going over lecture material in more detail with additional examples and for answering questions. Recitation attendance is optional, and you may attend any recitation you wish. BUT, if you are having trouble, we expect you to attend recitations weekly, and active participation may improve low grades.
